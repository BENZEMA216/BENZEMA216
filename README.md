## Hi, I'm BENZEMA 👋

**AI Builder × Product Thinker**

I build tools that empower creators with AI. Currently designing **Creative CoWork** — an AI-powered creative workbench for professional creators.

我相信 AI 应该让创作者更强大，而不是替代他们。

### 🧠 What I Think About

- **AI-Native Creative Tools** — How to design tools where AI is a creative partner, not just a feature
- **Claude Code Ecosystem** — Building skills, plugins, and workflows on top of Claude Code
- **Context Engineering** — Making AI understand and utilize the full context of creative work
- **Product Design** — User research, pain points, and the gap between tools and real workflows
