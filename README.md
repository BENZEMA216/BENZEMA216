## Hi, I'm Dongzhe Zhu (朱东哲) 👋

**AI Product Manager × Builder**

Currently at **ByteDance**, building the Creative AGENT for [Jimeng AI](https://jimeng.jianying.com) from 0→1 — 200K+ DAU, powering the main entry of Jimeng Web.

Previously shipped LLM-powered data products at **Tencent**, winning the 2023 Business Breakthrough Award.

在工作中做产品，在业余时间造工具。我相信最好的 AI 产品来自对用户创作流程的深刻理解。

### 🧠 What I Think About

- **AI-Native Creative Tools** — AI as a creative partner, not just a feature
- **AGENT Product Design** — Context engineering, post-training, and the UX of AI agents
- **Creator Workflows** — The gap between what tools offer and how creators actually work
